A poll conducted among 1,640 adults between January 24 and January 30, 2019, revealed that lower-income individuals allocate a significantly higher percentage of their income to engagement rings compared to wealthier counterparts. Those earning less than $23,000 annually spend a substantial 16.7% of their income—equivalent to 2.2 months' earnings—on engagement rings. In contrast, individuals earning between $58,000 and $90,000, and those with incomes above $90,000, spend only 3.1% of their income, or about 1.6 weeks' worth.
